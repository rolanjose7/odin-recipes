    <p>Time: 30min (10min prep & 20min cook)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cormneal (such as P.A.N)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</p>
