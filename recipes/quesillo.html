    <p>It's not everyday your grandmother asks you how to cook something! I will however warn you: quesillo is not for everyone.</p>
    <p>Time: 9 hrs 47 mins (Prep: 15 mins, Cook: 1 hr 7 mins & Additional: 8 hrs 25 mins)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Prepare a bain-marie, or water bath, by filling a 9-inch heat-proof container with water.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Melt sugar in a nonstick pan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until melted, 7 to 10 minutes; be careful to keep it from burning. Pour sugar into a flan mold, coating the sides to ensure that the egg/milk mixture in the next step will not touch the container.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Pour sweetened condensed milk into a bowl. Fill the empty can with milk and add to the bowl; stir in eggs and vanilla extract. Blend well. Fold mixture with a spatula or tap against the counter to remove air bubbles.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Pour milk mixture into the slightly cooled flan mold. Put the lid on and place inside the water bath; don't let the water go over the rim.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Bake the quesillo in the bain-marie in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Pry lid open with a knife carefully; continue baking until set, about 15 minutes more.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Let quesillo cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Slide a knife around the edges of the mold to loosen and invert onto a plate.</p>
